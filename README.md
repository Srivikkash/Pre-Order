# GKmilk-Order_page
order page for G.k. Milk Agency


I had created a ordering page for a private shop.

I used php,html,css,mysql as my required langauges in this project.

I had used xampp server for my php web host and sql local data base

I created a database named " orderlist "
It as two tables:
  *orders*
  *users_login*
  you can import tables by using the files 
      users_login,orders



I had created 10 modules for this project:

  *index.php*        ->main index as well as login page
  
  *registration.php* ->new registration

  *validation.php*    ->to validate the user
  
  *dbmanager.php*     ->new users db management

  *Admin.php*         ->Admin page for orders list view

  *config_ol.php*     ->configuration file for database

  *orderList.php*     ->Used to order with User interface

  *orderRecheck.php*  -> to recheck the orders before insert the database

  *orderdb.php*       ->To insert orders into the database

  *style.css*         ->Styling sheet
